Test Cases

1. // Trying to free unallocated block
Input:
	int puff;
	free(&puff);
Expected Output: ERROR: free() cannot free a pointer that was not dynamically allocated. An item on line 19 of main.c may have caused this.

2. // Trying to free dynamic memory not returned from malloc()
Input:
	char *lol = (char*) malloc(200);
	free(lol + 10); 
Expected Output: ERROR: free() cannot free a pointer that was not returned from malloc. An item on line 27 of main.c may have caused this.

3. // Redundant freeing of the same pointer
Input
	char *buns = (char*) malloc(100);
	free(buns); // haha get it?
	free(buns);
Expected Output: ERROR: free() cannot free a pointer that is unallocated. An item on line 36 of main.c may have caused this.

4. // Trying to allocate a block of size 0
Input:
	buns = (char*) malloc(0);
Expected Output: ERROR: free() cannot free a pointer that is unallocated. An item on line 36 of main.c may have caused this.

5. // Test saturation
Input: 
	char *pebble = (char*)malloc(100000000);
	free(pebble);
Expected Output: Nothing (Memory allocated and freed)

6.// Regular case
Input:	
	void* test = malloc(1);
	test = (char*)malloc(100);
	free(test);
	test = (char*)malloc(100);
	free(test);
Expected Output: Nothing (Memory allocated and freed)

This should also be outputted at the end to check for memory leaks:
ERROR: There was a memory leak. An item on line 26 of main.c may not have been free'd.
ERROR: There was a memory leak. An item on line 58 of main.c may not have been free'd.
